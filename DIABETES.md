# **2\. Background** {#2.-background}

1. ## **Document purpose** {#document-purpose}

The dataset and business rules documents produced by the NHS Digital Primary Care Domain General Practice Specification and Extraction Service are created primarily for the uses of GPES and GP system suppliers. These documents contain specifications to communicate technical details of extracts from Primary Care systems which may be used to provide practice-level information regarding services and/or allocate rewards, such as payments or QOF points.

This document is **not** intended to be used in place of clinical guidelines, but may be referred to by any individual or organisation to aid understanding of which patients and/or activity are included in each population or output. Non-technical, textual descriptions of business rules can be found in the table columns highlighted in pale blue throughout the document.

The business rules registers for QOF and Enhanced Services are constructed solely for the purpose of supporting the practice, GP Suppliers, and NHS England in fulfilling the claims and audit requirements for the indicators. Therefore, while a register may carry the name of a particular diagnosis for business rules purposes, it may well not be sufficiently precise to encompass all of those patients who might be clinically assessed as requiring follow-up or clinical intervention. It is advised that where a practice wishes to construct a register for the purposes of call, recall and clinical management that it is patient based rather than solely diagnosis based.

2. ## **Business rules supporting information** {#business-rules-supporting-information}

# Further information regarding the setup of the business rules, terminology used and the calculation methods can be found in version 1.6 of the supporting information document which can be accessed here:

#

# [https://content.digital.nhs.uk/qofesextractspecs](https://content.digital.nhs.uk/qofesextractspecs)

#

3. ## **Clinical codes** {#clinical-codes}

# The clinical code strings have been replaced by clinical reference sets (refsets). Both clinical refset and drug refset IDs are denoted by a ‘^’ prefix.

#

# Please note the content of clinical and drug refsets are subject to change over the course of a year. Drug refsets have the scope to be updated every 4 weeks. Clinical refsets will be updated at least twice a year. The latest content of refsets can be accessed using the files from [Technology Reference data Update Distribution (TRUD)](https://isd.digital.nhs.uk/trud3/user/guest/group/0/home) or [Primary Care Domain Reference Set Portal](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-collections/quality-and-outcomes-framework-qof/quality-and-outcome-framework-qof-business-rules/primary-care-domain-reference-set-portal).

# Guidance for all Quality Services can be found on the NHS England website through the following links:

5. ## **System prompts** {#system-prompts}

Please note: to support GP practices in enabling them to carry out QOF care reviews after two invitations for care have been coded, **clinical system prompts should not remove a patient from the indicator**.

Currently, once the second invite code has been added to the patient record, the Business Rules logic will remove the patient from the Denominator and clinical systems may automatically remove the prompt, removing the chance for opportunistic reviews where necessary. If a patient has not responded to the invitations, and has not received the intervention required by a given indicator, then that patient will be removed from the indicator via personalised care adjustments at year end. This is for payment purposes only. However, up until year end it is expected that such patients should still be flagged up to practices as requiring the care specified by the indicator.

_\* For the purposes of the business rules ‘Cumulative’ data collections are extracts which have varying incremental end dates but where groups of extracts or all extracts have a single start date e.g. each extract across the year starts at the QSSD and is taken up to the achievement date. Due to the fact that patients may change practice during the year this is not a true cumulative data collection as patients may drop out of counts or enter counts at a later stage; however, this is the terminology used in this document to describe these kinds of counts. ‘Non-cumulative’ refers to data collections which are discrete extracts between two dates. These non-cumulative data collections do not overlap._

2. ### **Populations** {#populations}

1. #### **Case registers**

This register/count is based on diagnosis and may not be sufficiently precise to encompass all of those patients who require follow-up or clinical intervention. Therefore, if you wish to construct a register for the purposes of call, recall and clinical management, we recommend that you make a ‘patient’ based register.

_Each patient can only be included once per register._

Currently, once the second invite code has been added to the patient record, the Business Rules logic will remove the patient from the Denominator and clinical systems may automatically remove the prompt, removing the chance for opportunistic reviews where necessary. If a patient has not responded to the invitations, and has not received the intervention required by a given indicator, then that patient will be removed from the indicator via personalised care adjustments at year end. This is for payment purposes only. However, up until year end it is expected that such patients should still be flagged up to practices as requiring the care specified by the indicator._ |

Pass all remaining patients to the next rule. _Please note: To support GP practices in enabling them to carry out QOF care reviews after two invitations for care have been coded, **clinical system prompts should not remove a patient from the indicator**. Currently, once the second invite code has been added to the patient record, the Business Rules logic will remove the patient from the Denominator and clinical systems may automatically remove the prompt, removing the chance for opportunistic reviews where necessary. If a patient has not responded to the invitations, and has not received the intervention required by a given indicator, then that patient will be removed from the indicator via personalised care adjustments at year end. This is for payment purposes only. However, up until year end it is expected that such patients should still be flagged up to practices as requiring the care specified by the indicator._ |

Pass all remaining patients to the next rule. _Please note: to support GP practices in enabling them to carry out QOF care reviews after two invitations for care have been coded, **clinical system prompts should not remove a patient from the indicator**. Currently, once the second invite code has been added to the patient record, the Business Rules logic will remove the patient from the Denominator and clinical systems may automatically remove the prompt, removing the chance for opportunistic reviews where necessary. If a patient has not responded to the invitations, and has not received the intervention required by a given indicator, then that patient will be removed from the indicator via personalised care adjustments at year end. This is for payment purposes only. However, up until year end it is expected that such patients should still be flagged up to practices as requiring the care specified by the indicator._ |

Received two invitations for diabetes monitoring and had no blood pressure recordings during the 12 months leading up to and including the achievement date. Pass all remaining patients to the next rule. _Please note: to support GP practices in enabling them to carry out QOF care reviews after two invitations for care have been coded, **clinical system prompts should not remove a patient from the indicator**. Currently, once the second invite code has been added to the patient record, the Business Rules logic will remove the patient from the Denominator and clinical systems may automatically remove the prompt, removing the chance for opportunistic reviews where necessary. If a patient has not responded to the invitations, and has not received the intervention required by a given indicator, then that patient will be removed from the indicator via personalised care adjustments at year end.

Received two invitations for diabetes monitoring and had no IFCC-HbA1c recorded during the 12 months leading up to and including the achievement date. Pass all remaining patients to the next rule. _Please note: To support GP practices in enabling them to carry out QOF care reviews after two invitations for care have been coded, **clinical system prompts should not remove a patient from the indicator**. Currently, once the second invite code has been added to the patient record, the Business Rules logic will remove the patient from the Denominator and clinical systems may automatically remove the prompt, removing the chance for opportunistic reviews where necessary. If a patient has not responded to the invitations, and has not received the intervention required by a given indicator, then that patient will be removed from the indicator via personalised care adjustments at year end. This is for payment purposes only. However, up until year end it is expected that such patients should still be flagged up to practices as requiring the care specified by the indicator._ |

Received two invitations for diabetes monitoring and had no IFCC-HbA1c recorded during the 12 months leading up to and including the achievement date. Pass all remaining patients to the next rule. _Please note: to support GP practices in enabling them to carry out QOF care reviews after two invitations for care have been coded, **clinical system prompts should not remove a patient from the indicator**. Currently, once the second invite code has been added to the patient record, the Business Rules logic will remove the patient from the Denominator and clinical systems may automatically remove the prompt, removing the chance for opportunistic reviews where necessary. If a patient has not responded to the invitations, and has not received the intervention required by a given indicator, then that patient will be removed from the indicator via personalised care adjustments at year end. This is for payment purposes only. However, up until year end it is expected that such patients should still be flagged up to practices as requiring the care specified by the indicator._ |

Pass all remaining patients to the next rule. _Please note: to support GP practices in enabling them to carry out QOF care reviews after two invitations for care have been coded, **clinical system prompts should not remove a patient from the indicator**. Currently, once the second invite code has been added to the patient record, the Business Rules logic will remove the patient from the Denominator and clinical systems may automatically remove the prompt, removing the chance for opportunistic reviews where necessary. If a patient has not responded to the invitations, and has not received the intervention required by a given indicator, then that patient will be removed from the indicator via personalised care adjustments at year end. This is for payment purposes only. However, up until year end it is expected that such patients should still be flagged up to practices as requiring the care specified by the indicator._ |

Pass all remaining patients to the next rule. _Please note: to support GP practices in enabling them to carry out QOF care reviews after two invitations for care have been coded, **clinical system prompts should not remove a patient from the indicator**. Currently, once the second invite code has been added to the patient record, the Business Rules logic will remove the patient from the Denominator and clinical systems may automatically remove the prompt, removing the chance for opportunistic reviews where necessary. If a patient has not responded to the invitations, and has not received the intervention required by a given indicator, then that patient will be removed from the indicator via personalised care adjustments at year end. This is for payment purposes only. However, up until year end it is expected that such patients should still be flagged up to practices as requiring the care specified by the indicator._ |
